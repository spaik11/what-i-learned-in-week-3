### Intro to Functions with Parameters/Arguments
A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.
* Function **parameters** are the names listed in the function's definition.
* Function **arguments** are the real values passed to the function.
* Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.

Two kinds of parameters:
**input parameters**
* the most common kind; they pass values into functions.

**output/return parameters**
* primarily return multiple values from a function, but not recommended since they cause confusion.

### Return Function Technique
Parameters let us give input to our functions; `return` gives us output.
* Whatever is immediately after `return` becomes the output of our function.
* All Functions Return SOMETHING, but if you don't explicitly return, JS returns `undefined` for you.

### Return Of The String
This exercise was a great opportunity to practice different ways we use `strings` in a function. I liked how there were different ways to come up with the solution.
* Challenges:
  * Using other functions within the function, keeping in mind the original parameters.
  * Concatenating a function and being able to return the initials using the `indexOf` syntax.
